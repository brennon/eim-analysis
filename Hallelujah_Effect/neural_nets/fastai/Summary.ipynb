    "  - Training on *Hallelujah* and predicting reactions in other stimuli\n",
    "  - Training/predicting taking all simuli together\n",
    "  - Training on *Into Dust* and predicting on *Into Dust*\n",
    "  - Training on *Raining Blood* and predicting on *Raining Blood*\n",
    "  - Pairwise training/predicting between individual stimuli\n",
    "  - Training on *Hallelujah* and predicting reactions in other stimuli after \"categorifying\" LIkert-type item responses\n",

    "# Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take model that uses only features already presented and use for prediction on other stimuli (with same features, locations, etc.)\n",
    "- Calculate weighted F-beta for models (for comparison with previous results)\n",
    "- Incorporate baseline classifier and corresponding PR curve / F-beta plots\n",
    "- Unique locations (at least for first model) in test dataset that are not in training dataset\n",
    "- Check with Graduate School on defense deadline ahead of graduation"
